# OrderVis
It's a interface for ReorderVis, a tool that can rise the explainability of your Rnn Model.


This system is divided into two parts - browser side and machine learning side. The machine learning side calculates interpretable information of the RNN model the researcher set based on the input and the prediction value of the input reordered by the end user. The machine learning part can run directly to provide part of the interpretability. The code has been placed under the machine learning side branch.


While the browser side is responsible for the functions of visualization and interaction, which greatly improves the interpretability with the help of the machine learning side. If you need to use our system, you need to run the browser side and machine learning side on the same or two machines.
